## DE Proj 3 ##

This is the third project for the Data Engineering course. In this project, I connected GCP with Codespace and utilized public dataset from BigQuery for further analysis. I chose listenbrainz, a music platform, on which includes user name, music album and track they listen to, and the date they listened to the music.
